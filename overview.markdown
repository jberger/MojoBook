## Overview

### The Relationship Between Mojo and Mojolicious

While the names Mojo and Mojolicious get used almost interchangably in common usage they are very distinct in a technical sense.
Mojolicious (and the other classes in the Mojolicious namespace) is the high level web framework.
It is built atop Mojo (and its related classes) which are a set of reusable tools used to implement web frameworks.

Mojolicious was historically (and in some sense still is) a reference implementation of a framework built on Mojo.
As Mojolicious has become popular however it has taken on an importance which most reference implementations never do.
The development of the two namespaces has been related and Mojo is well tailored to implement Mojolicious.

That said care is taken to keep Mojo separated from Mojolicious.
Most of the components you will see in a request response cycle are actually Mojo classes.
The servers, transactions, messages, templates, parsers, and encoders are all Mojo classes.
So how does a Mojo server serve a Mojolicious application?

It might come as a surprise but there are actually two levels of web application you can implement.
Your application is typically either an instance of Mojolicious (especially if it is a Lite app) or else an instance of a subclass of it.
However Mojolicious is actually a subclass of the basic web application, Mojo.

Mojo is a low-level web application "framework".
At a basic level a Mojo application implements a method called `handler`.
When a Mojo::Server (or subclass) gets a new request, it builds a Mojo::Transaction (technially it asks your app to to so, but this is usually pretty transparent).
The message parsing is done at this level, creating instances of subclasses of Mojo::Message for the request and the response.
Then the server calls your application's `handler` method with that transaction as an argument.

What the Mojolicious class does is implement this handler method in such a way as to provide the rich api that Mojolicious authors experience.
The routing is done via Mojolicious::Routes, the controllers are Mojolicious::Controllers.
The stash, flash, sessions and renderer are all implemented at the Mojolicious level.

If you are still confused, remember the following.
It is common for Mojolicious-level classes to build and use objects from the Mojo namespace.
Mojo-level classes never build Mojolicious-level classes.

### The Transaction Object

When the server gets a request from its TCP socket, the first thing it does is get a Mojo::Transaction object to represent it.
For consistency, all classes in the Mojo ecosystem that hold a transaction store it in an attribute called `tx`.
Additionally, by convention a variable that contains a transaction is called `$tx`.

This object is a container holding both a Mojo::Message::Request (`$tx->req`) and a Mojo::Message::Response (`$tx->res`), both of which are subclasses of Mojo::Message.
The request object will contain the parsed request after it has been parsed; the response object is where the application will define the message to be written to the client.

Interestingly, the server doesn't actually create the transaction object, it asks the application object to build one.
This is done so that your application can take some action very early in the request/response cycle.
In a pure Mojo app all it does is build the transaction object.
In a Mojolicious object it does that and also emits the `after_build_tx` hook (a hook is a special kind of application-wide event).
Technically an application class can overload the `build_tx` method that does this, but it is suggested not to do so but rather to make use of that emitted hook.

### The Controller Object

After the transaction is built and the Mojo handler is invoked now the Mojolicious framework is in full control.
On the first request the application does some setup, but on all requests the first thing that the application does is call `build_controller`.
In a Mojolicious application, the request/response cycle is governed by a Mojolicious::Controller instance (or an instance of a subclass).
A new instance is created for each request and is used throughout the handling of it from the routing to rendering a response.
The controller presents many useful methods and contains all of the data.
By convention, the variable that holds the controller is called `$c`.

The controller is the invocant for controller actions (the code body that is run to handle a request), router callbacks, and helpers (which are methods that share code application-wide), all of which will be discussed at length later.
They can be used to render templates or other data to the client.
Although normally a response is sent to the client all at once (a simple reply), data can also be sent in chunks, streamed, or even as a websocket for bidirectional communication with the client.

Remember that Mojolicious is built to be nonblocking and therefore all data must be contained on an instance of an object rather than in global variables.
The three most important data containers are the transaction (`$c->tx`), the stash (`$c->stash`) and the session (`$c->session`), of which, the transaction has already been discussed.

### The Stash

As seen before, the data representing the incoming request and the outgoing response are stored on the transaction object's messages.
But during the request it can be handy to hold temporary "scratch pad" kind of information for your own use.
Each controller instance, representing a single client request, contains within it a hash reference called the stash.
At first glance this stash is just a scratch pad, and certainly it can be used that way, but it is really much more.

The stash receives the placholder values from the routes.
It defines the controller class and action to dispatch to and/or the template to render.
It lets the app set the response status code and format.
It can define rendering parameters including complex template inheritances and many other behaviors.

When defining a route in a Lite application (or using a "hybrid route") simply pass a hash reference to the route definition after the path; this will be used as the starting point for the initial stash.
(In a full application, you can set the the stash defaults with the curiously named `to` method.)

Using route stash defaults is seen in the first Mojolicious application a new user will write: the "hello world" application.
In the Mojolicious version of this famous application (one which just says "hello world" to the client), you see the first use of the stash in this way.

```perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

get '/' => { text => 'Hello world!' };

app->start;
```

This app defines a handler for an HTTP GET request to the `/` path and tells the router to set the default stash for this request to contain a key of `text` with the value of the message to be replied.
Since there is no dynamic behavior, the controller object is never seen, but it exists and it sees the `text` key in the stash and uses it to render the response to the client.

In a full application, the stash defaults often contain `controller` and `action` which tell the router which controller class to instantiate and which method to dispatch to.
Other common stash keys include `status` to specify the status code, `format` to set the `Content-Type` header for known types, and `json` to automatically render a data structure as a JSON document (which knows to set the format to json).

The "hello world" example above actually set the `Content-Type` to `text/html` since that is the default.
This may seem strange, but consider the case of manually creating html.
One might as well render `<html><head><title>Hello world!</title></head><body><h1>Hello world!</h1></body></html>` as text.
Rather than the initial assumption that the `text` stash value means that you want to render raw text, it really means that you are rendering textual data.
That textual data is encoded as utf8 before being sent to the client.

To demonstrate this, the following example renders unicode text and also sets the format to `txt` so that the `Content-Type` is `text/plain`.

```perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

get '/' => { text => 'Hello ðŸŒŽ!', format => 'txt' };

app->start;
```

If instead the data should not be encoded as utf8, use the `data` key instead, as is the case of this base64 encoded one black pixel gif.

```perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;
use Mojo::Util 'b64_decode';

get '/' => {
  data   => b64_decode 'R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=',
  format => 'gif',
};

app->start;
```

Of course Mojolicious has better ways of rendering base64 encoded files and static files in general.

### The Session

So, the stash is the place to store scratch-pad data during a request/response cycle.
It has one weakness though, after the cycle ends, the stash goes away.
It would have to, it is stored on the controller object which also goes away at that point.
What is missing is a way to store data across multiple requests.

Of course this mirrors the fact that HTTP is a stateless protocol.
By design you are simply asking for certain data and a server responds to you with some result.
At this point the request is over, maybe even the connection is closed.
In fact, even if the server did try to save some state information about your last request, on the next request you might not even hit the same server again!

Web applications have gotten around this limitation by sending state information back to th client at the end of a request and the clients send it along with the next one.
This message is playfully named a "cookie".
A cookie is bound to a host and path; it might have expiration time and other validation too.

When a site is requested, the client looks to see if it has a valid cookie matching that host and path and if it does, it gets sent as a header along with the actual request.
Then at then end of the request the server decides what if any data it needs to get on the next request in order to appear stateful.
This data is sent back to the client, again via a header, and the value and validation critera are stored in a "cookie jar" for the next time they are needed.

In Mojolicoius, the session uses a cookie to store state on the client side between requests.
The controller has a session method which represents the data in the cookie as a hash reference, much like the stash.
Simply use it as you would any other hash, but magically, at the end of the request, this data gets serialized to JSON, base 64 encoded, signed and stuffed in a cookie sent to the client.
On the next request the data is verified, decoded and made available to the controller again, as if nothing happend.

In the following example, we store the time of the first access in the session on the first request.
From then on the value simply sits in the session, request after request, to be displayed next to the current time.

```perl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

get '/' => sub {
  my $c = shift;
  my $first = $c->session->{first} ||= localtime;
  $c->render(text => "You first visited at $first, the time is now " . localtime);
};

app->start;
```

The reader might notice that the request is signed and then later verified.
This is important because since the data is stored on the client side, the client could in theory alter it.
If what you store in the session is some identification, like a username, simply trusting the cookie could lead to all kinds of trouble.
By signing the cookie cryptographically and then verifying it, we can know that the data hasn't been tampered with.
If the validation fails, the application will simply see an empty session.

Now for some caveats.
The data is signed, but not encrypted, don't store private data in the session!
Good session data might include a display name, a username, user roles, or perhaps a session token that can be used to look up private data in a database.
Never store passwords in a session!
Also, session cookies are limited in the same way that cookies are, most notably there is a size limit of 4kB in serialized form.
If your application needs large amounts of session state, store a lookup id in the session storage and use it to lookup data in a database instead.

### Batteries Included

Mojolicious is more than just about routing requests and generating responses.
Mojo comes bundled with lots of additional functionality to get you off and running quickly.
These include Mojo::UserAgent a non-blocking http client, Mojo::DOM a DOM parser with CSS3 selectors, Mojo::JSON for JSON parsing and emitting, and many others.
These tools have lots of uses, and they all designed for consistent api and user experience, but I'll argue that they shine best in the testing library Test::Mojo.

Modern web applications must be well tested to ensure that it does what you expect, both now and in the future.
Test::Mojo uses the power of these batteries-included libraries to provide a rich and powerful testing environment for your application and even other websites.
In fact, because I consider testing to be so important, in the next chapters, before I really even get to the web framework, I will introduce some of these additional libraries.
In this way, when we get to learning the how to write a web application, we can learn to test it at the same time.
